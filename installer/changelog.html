<h2>Version 1.2.0 (2011-09-15)</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>

   <li>Added the ability to mark user accounts inactive. Inactive users will not be able to log in to the game. Forum notification posts are automatically added to a user's group when it is enabled/disabled.</li>

   <li>Added "Help" forums, a separate set of in-game forums where users can discuss issues with STANCE functionality and receive help.</li>
   <li>Added "Permission" tab to edit scenario window. This allows for permissions of all users of a type to be permanently changed, and edits the default permissions for a user type.</li>
